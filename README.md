## Repository Structure

This repository follows a weekly structure. Each `Week_N` folder contains hands-on solutions aligned with the topics and skills covered during that week.

```

├── README.md
└── Week_1
├── Algorithms_Data_Structures
│   ├── E-commerce_Platform_Search
│   │   ├── code
│   │   ├── output
│   │   └── Asymptotic_Notation.md
│   └── Financial_Forecasting

└── Design_Patterns_and_Principles
├── FactoryMethodExample

```

**Note**: Each `Main.java` file inside the `code/` directory is the entry point for that specific exercise. Running this file executes the associated solution.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical workspace for the DN4.0 Java FSE learning program. It is intended to:

- Document weekly hands-on assignments.
- Apply concepts from topics such as design patterns, data structures, Spring Boot, REST APIs, and microservices.
- Reinforce understanding through implementation and practice.
- Track learning progress and outcomes throughout the program.

Each submission reflects knowledge gained from both self-paced modules and SME-led sessions.

---

## Technologies Used

- Java 17 or higher
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, etc.)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Maven (in upcoming weeks)
- Spring Boot (in upcoming weeks)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/DN4\_Java\_FSE\_Janhvi\_Shukla\_6400950.git](https://github.com/your-username/DN4_Java_FSE_Janhvi_Shukla_6400950.git)

```

2. Navigate to the desired module:
```

cd Week\_1/Algorithms\_Data\_Structures/E-commerce\_Platform\_Search/code

```

3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file:
